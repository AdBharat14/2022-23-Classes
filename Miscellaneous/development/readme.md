## FAQ

<dl>
<dt>
1.) How to choose among different domains in development, which one is best?
</dt>
<dd>
There is no "best" domain as such. You should choose one specific domain that interests you. Let's say, if you've chosen web dev, then your aim must be to learn the fundamentals of it. When you later try a different domain, you'll realize that conceptually it won't be that hard.
