*	### What is HTML?
	* HTML stands for **Hyper Text Markup Language**.
	* HTML is used to create web pages and web applications.
	* We can create a static website by HTML only.
	* Technically, HTML is a **Markup language** (helps to format the overall view of a page and the data it contains) rather than a programming language.


*	### Basic Structure of HTML file
	* `<!DOCTYPE html>` tag indicates **HTML 5** document.
	* `<html>` tag is the container for all other HTML elements (except `<!DOCTYPE html>`).
	* The `<head>` element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the `<html>` tag and the `<body>` tag.
	* Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.
	* The `<body>` element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.

	#### [structure.html](./structure.html)
	```html
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	   <head>
	      <title>This is document title</title>
	   </head>	
	   <body>
	      <h1>This is a heading</h1>
	      <p>Hello World!</p>
	   </body>	
	</html>
	```

*	### HTML Tags
	* HTML tags are like keywords which defines that how web browser will format and display the content.
	* With the help of tags, a web browser can distinguish between an HTML content and a simple content.
	* *Generally*, HTML tags contain three main parts: **opening tag**, **content** and **closing tag**.
	* *Example*:
	```html
	<p> This is an HTML tutorial </p>
	```
	* Some tags need not be closed. Example: `<br>`, `<hr>`, etc.
	* Some **attributes** are present in each tag which define properties of that tag.
