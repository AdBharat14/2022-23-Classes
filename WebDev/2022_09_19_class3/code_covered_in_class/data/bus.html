    <p>
        A bus travels on the road and is used as a means of transport
    via roads. Typically, a bus can carry between ten to fifty passengers. Buses
    are commonly used as a means of public transport but they are also used by
    companies, organisations or even by a group of families for private
    transport. A public transport bus, has a ticket conductor along with the bus
    driver. The ticker conductor is responsible for sale of tickets and also for
    checking that all passengers have bought the tickets.
