      Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited is a British
      luxury automobile maker. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited operates from
      purpose-built administrative and production facilities opened in 2003
      across from the historic Goodwood Circuit in Goodwood, West Sussex,
      England, United Kingdom. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited is the exclusive
      manufacturer of Rolls-Royce branded motor cars since 2003. The BBC called
      Rolls-Royce "probably one of the most recognised icons in the world", and
      that "the name Rolls-Royce entered the English language as a
      superlative."[3] A marketing survey in 1987 showed that only Coca-Cola was
      a more widely known brand than Rolls-Royce.[4]
