    <h1>Children love their bicycles</h1>
    <p>
      As they grow old enough to ride, they enjoy
      their first cycle, and it is a memory that stays with them for a long
      time. Children enjoy little moments associated with their bikes. Whether
      it is cycling around the compound with friends or feeling like the
      responsible little helper by riding to nearby stores to bring small
      household requirements, children and their bicycles are inseparable. When
      asked to write an essay on the topic, they can write small paragraphs
      discussing their experiences or elaborate compositions bringing in some
      facts and general knowledge with detailed descriptions. This exercise will
      lay the foundation of their English grammar and improve their writing
      skills. It also improves their vocabulary. Let us guide your children of
      classes 1, 2 and 3 to write a beautiful composition on this topic.
